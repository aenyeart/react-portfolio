      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andrew Enyeart, a software developer with a diverse background including firefighting, linguistics, education, and most recently, bartending. I decided to pivot from bartending to coding because for me, the most magical aspect of being human is the experience of figuring out how things work, and I was hungry for the intellectual challenges that coding provides. I love how focused my mind becomes when I'm solving interesting coding problems, and I work best when I can do deep work independently followed by collaboration with others. I'd love to work in an environment that capitalizes on my critical analysis, attention to detail, customer empathy, and the communication skills I've cultivated from the many customer-facing roles I've held.",
